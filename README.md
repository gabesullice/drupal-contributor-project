Drupal Contributor Project
===

The Drupal Contributor Project is a composer project template for Drupal core
and contrib maintainers.

Drupal's official installation instructions recommend that Drupal be installed
using [Composer](getcomposer.org). However, when Drupal is installed using this
method, it is difficult to develop core patches because the resulting root
directory is not equivalent to a direct Git clone of the Drupal project.

Many times, to make Drupal contribution easier, it is simpler to do direct Git
checkouts of Drupal core and/or contributed projects. However, that approach has
many drawbacks. One must customize git ignore files, one cannot easily manage
a module's composer dependencies, and any patches required by a module that are
included in a `composer.json` file are not automatically applied. Thus, many
Drupal contributors choose not to use Composer for their day-to-day workflow.
This can often lead to bugs in `composer.json` and out-of-date `composer.json`
files.

This project is an attempt to make all that better. It does so by establishing
a Composer project that uses Git checkouts and symlinks to create a directory
structure that is conducive to Drupal contributions _and_ a composer-based
workflow.

The trade-off is a somewhat brittle installation that is likely not suitable for
"real", production Drupal applications.

## Usage

It's simple, replace the placeholder and run this single command:

```shell
composer create-project -s dev --repository='{"type":"vcs","url":"git@github.com:gabesullice/drupal-contributor-project.git"}' drupal/contributor-project {{ PROJECT_NAME }}
```

To develop a module that lives on Drupal.org, simply require it:

```shell
composer require drupal/cdn
```

_Note_: If your contrib module applies patches to Drupal core, you must run
`composer update` after requiring it.

The resulting directory structure will look like this:

```
composer.json
contrib
â†³ modules
  â†³ cnd
    â†³ .git
  themes
  profiles
  libraries
web
â†³ .git
  index.php
  sites
  â†³ default
    â†³ default.settings.php
      files
      # etc.
  modules
  â†³ contrib -> ../../contrib/modules # symlink to the top-level contrib/modules directory.
  themes
  â†³ themes -> ../../contrib/themes # symlink.
  profiles
  â†³ profiles -> ../../contrib/profiles # symlink.
  libraries
  â†³ libraries -> ../../contrib/libraries # symlink.
  # etc.
vendor
â†³ bin
  autoload.php
  # etc.
```
